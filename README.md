What is Secreta?
----------------

Secreta is a sustainable digital currency that aims to ensure unique individual privacy for everyone,
everywhere in the world. The Secreta Project deals with raising people's awareness of creating their own true economic independence without intermediaries, 
through improved P2P technology within the reach of all low-end devices.

Decentralize is our faith. Fast is our path. Easy is our key word.
